 * \brief Types used by REPY to represent entities that exist outside of mod code.

 * Generally, these are represented using integer values.
 * @{
 */

/**
 * @brief Represents a Python object in REPY API functions. 
 * 
 * Technically, the handle is a unsigned integer value between 0x00000001 and 0xFFFFFFFF, inclusive. The REPY external library
 * will look up the corresponding Python object from an internally managed slot map. A handle is considered 'valid'
 * if the value is assigned to a Python object. 
 * 
 * In terms of Python's reference-count-based garbage collection, each valid handle counts as a single reference 
 * to an object, and multiple handles can be mapped to a single Python object. Once created, a handle must be released
 * to remove that reference, either by using `REPY_Release` or flagging the handle as Single-Use (more on that below). 
 * If you need multiple references to a Python object, you can get a new handle to the same object using `REPY_CopyHandle`.
 * With the exception of `REPY_MakeSUH`, `REPY_VariadicLocals` and `REPY_VL_SUH`, any REPY API function that returns a REPY_Handle always creates a new handle. 
 * Failure to release handles will result in resource/memory leaks. 
 * 
 * The handle value of `REPY_NO_OBJECT` (the numerical value 0) is a special case, and represents the absense of any Python object. 
 * Note that this is different from Python's `None`, which is itself a Python object. If an API function with `REPY_Handle`
 * as the return type returns `REPY_NO_OBJECT`, that will mean a Python error has occured (unless otherwise specified in the function's 
 * documentation).
 * 
 * There are a few cases where a REPY_Handle of `REPY_NO_OBJECT` is acceptable as a function argument, indicating that the argument
 * is not used. These arguments are named with the `_nullable` suffix.
 * 
 * Handles can be flagged as Single-Use, which means that the handle will be immediately released after it's next use in a REPY
 * API function. This is primarily to allow nesting calls to REPY API functions without incurring resource/memory leaks. Any handle
 * can be flagged as Single-Use using `REPY_MakeSUH` or `REPY_SetSUH`, and the Single-Use status can be checked with `REPY_GetSUH`.
 * Several common REPY API functions have alternative versions that automatically return a Single Use handle. These functions will
 * have the suffix `_SUH` in their names.
 * 
 * Not that the only functions that won't release a Single-Use handle are ones meant to manipulate the handles themselves:
 * * `REPY_MakeSUH`
 * * `REPY_IsValidHandle`
 * * `REPY_GetSUH`
 * * `REPY_SetSUH`
 * * `REPY_DeferredCleanupHelper_AddHandle`
 * 
 * Their REPY_Handle argument names have the suffix `_no_release`
 * to reflect this.
 * 
 * If at any point this documentation refers to a `REPY_Handle` as a Python object, understand that it is referring to the Python object that
 * the handle represents. The mechanism for mapping `REPY_Handle` values to Python objects is written entirely in C++, and the Python interpreter 
 * does not have access to it.

/** \defgroup repy_interpreter_funcs (Sub)Interpreter Functions
 * \brief Functions Used for REPY's Interpreter Stack, which handles interpreter/subinterpreter operations as well as `PyThreadState` management.
 * 
 * REPY used a free-threaded build of Python, with the traditional Python GIL is a non-factor. However, the CPython still needs to know whether
 * or not a given thread needs access to the interpreter (and when subinterpreters are in use, which interpreter) using an opaque struct in CPython
 * called `PyThreadState`.
 *
 * Because the mod developer has no control over what other mods a player may install, and whether these mods use REPY, no single mod can be given 
 * responsibility for managing the `PyThreadState` directly. Therefore, REPY implements something called the Interpreter Stack: If a given mod code
 * thread requires access to the main interpreter, a call to `REPY_PushInterpreter` tells REPY a mod needs access to a specific interpreter, and a 
 * call to `REPY_PopInterpreter` tells REPY that the previously requested access is no longer needed. Using this, REPY itself manages the `PyThreadState`
 * of a given N64Recompiled thread, making changes to the state only necessary.
 * 
 * For this reason, it is recommended to call `REPY_PushInterpreter` at the top of any function that needs Python interpreter access, and to call
 * `REPY_PopInterpreter` before that function returns. The exception is when `REPY_FN` macros, as the setup and cleanup macros will automatically do 
 * this for you.
 * 
 waitr* See \ref repy_performance_interpreter_stack for potential performance pitfalls related to Interpreter Stack management.
